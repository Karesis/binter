A high-performance, thread-safe string interner backed by a concurrent bump allocator.

`binter` is designed to provide extremely fast string-to-symbol interning in a multi-threaded environment. It is especially useful for applications that frequently compare strings, such as compilers, databases, or game engines, by converting expensive string comparisons into trivial integer comparisons.

---

## âœ¨ Features

* **High Performance & Concurrency**: The read path (looking up a symbol) uses an `RwLock` for concurrent access, while the write path's memory allocation is handled by a concurrency-optimized `SyncBump` allocator with a lock-free fast path.
* **Blazingly Fast Allocation**: Backed by a bump allocator, allocating new strings is typically as fast as a pointer bump.
* **Thread-Safe by Design**: Intended to be used as a global static instance, safely shared across all threads.
* **Lightweight Symbols**: The `Symbol` type is a `Copy`-able wrapper around a `u32`, making it cheap to pass, store, and use as a `HashMap` key.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Add `binter` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
cargo add binter
```

Or add it manually:

```toml
[dependencies]
binter = "0.1.0"
once_cell = "1.21.3" # Recommended for creating the global instance
```

### Usage Example

`binter` is designed to be used as a **global static instance**. The `once_cell` crate is the idiomatic way to create such an instance.

```rust
use binter::Interner;
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;

// 1. Create a global, thread-safe Interner instance.
static GLOBAL_INTERNER: Lazy<Interner<'static>> = Lazy::new(|| Interner::with_capacity(1024));

fn main() {
    // 2. Intern strings from different places (or threads).
    let sym_hello = GLOBAL_INTERNER.intern("hello");
    let sym_world = GLOBAL_INTERNER.intern("world");
    let sym_hello_again = GLOBAL_INTERNER.intern("hello");

    // 3. The same string yields the same Symbol.
    assert_eq!(sym_hello, sym_hello_again);
    assert_ne!(sym_hello, sym_world);

    // 4. You can quickly resolve the original string from a Symbol.
    let resolved_str = GLOBAL_INTERNER.resolve(sym_world);
    assert_eq!(resolved_str, Some("world"));

    println!("Symbol for 'hello': {:?}", sym_hello);
    println!("'world' string is: {}", resolved_str.unwrap());
}
```

## ðŸ“œ Project Status & Background

### Origin

Rather than being extracted from a single project, `binter`'s design is the culmination of experience gained from prototyping and rewriting several compiler versions for the planned [Nyan programming language](https://github.com/Karesis/nyan-lang). It was developed to be a robust, reusable component for language tooling.

### Application & Current Stage

`binter`'s first concrete application is the [cact compiler](https://github.com/Karesis/cact), a work-in-progress compiler for a subset of C developed for a university course on Compiler Principles.

While the design has been refined through extensive iteration, the library itself is an early-stage release (`0.1.x`). It has not yet been extensively benchmarked in domains outside of compilers (e.g., web services, gaming). Contributions for more test cases and performance benchmarks are highly welcome!

## Acknowledgements

The design and implementation of the underlying `SyncBump` allocator are heavily inspired by the excellent [`bumpalo`](https://github.com/rust-lang/bumpalo) crate. Thank you to its authors for their great work for the Rust community.
